        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Hi, I am Can Deniz Gökgedik. I became interested in programming at a young age because I was <strong>curious</strong> about how websites were made. Using free tools I found on the internet, I created and published websites. I designed sites using <strong>Dreamweaver</strong>.I learned to use Dreamweaver and Flash. <strong>My biggest goal</strong> was to launch a website with a <strong>.com domain</strong> and attract visitors.</p>
        <p>Until the high school entrance exam, I spent my time <strong>producing content</strong> on the computer. In 8th grade, I took a break due to exam preparations. However, I resumed programming in high school. </p>
        <p>In 9th grade, I developed a <strong>geography terms dictionary program</strong> using Visual Basic for my geography class. In 2017, I launched a website with a .com domain. I built the website using <strong>HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP</strong>. Here is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180204140043/http://tundel.com/" target="_blank">Web Archive link</a> to the site. I no longer own the <strong>domain</strong> of this site. I took another break from programming to prepare for the university entrance exam. While studying in the preparatory year, I started watching <strong>Java tutorials online.</strong></p>
        <p>Throughout <strong>my computer engineering education</strong>, I have been involved in web development, <strong>SEO</strong>, and mobile development. In my third year of university, I completed a four-month internship at Episto. During this internship, I improved my skills in <strong>web development</strong> and also gained knowledge about SEO.</p>
